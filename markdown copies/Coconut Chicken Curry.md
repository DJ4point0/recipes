## Method
Heat olive oil in a deep-bottomed skillet or dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Saute the onion and garlic 3-5 minutes until soft. Add the curry powder, cayenne pepper, ground coriander, ground cumin, and ginger powder mixing well and cooking 3-5 minutes until spices start to stick to the pot. Stir in the tomato paste until softened, 2-3 minutes. Reduce heat if needed. Add the tomato, cooking 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Stir in coconut milk, and the chicken or vegetable stock, mixing thoroughly. Turn up heat to medium-high and boil for 5-10 minutes[^3], stirring occasionally[^4]. Reduce head and add the salt, simmering for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

While the sauce is simmering[^5], sprinkle the chicken with curry powder, turmeric, and salt. In a large frying pan, heat some olive oil until shimmering. Cook the chicken in batches until the flesh is firm. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels. Transfer chicken to the curry sauce and serve.

*Serve on top of basmati rice and topped with sauteed spinach.*

[^1]: You can just dice and use the whole onion and it won't make much difference. Don't have to worry about how you're going to use the other onion half now.
[^2]: A can of diced tomatoes, drained, also works.
[^3]: Of course, the more time you cook it the thicker the curry sauce will be. I prefer it on the thicker side.
[^4]: Stir it pretty frequently actually. Else the bottom will burn.
[^5]: It usually takes me a longer than 20 minutes to do the chicken. I'll start sauteing when I start the sauce.
